# Script Plugins

Avogadro can be extended easily using Python scripts:

- [charges / electrostatics](charges)
- [commands](commands)
- [input generators](generators)
- [file formats](formats)

More script types are anticipated in the future, including:

- force field calculators
- web databases
- custom colors

Scripts can either be installed manually, by dragging to the Avogadro window:

![installing script](/_images/install-script.png)

Scripts can also be installed from GitHub repositories through the "Download Pluginsâ€¦" command:

![plugin download](/_images/plugin-download.png)
