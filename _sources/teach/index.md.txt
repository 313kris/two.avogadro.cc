Avogadro is intended not only for molecular modeling research, but also for educational use. This category is intended to help educators around the world find lessons and tips for using Avogadro 2 in teaching chemistry. If you have an exercise or article that you would like to list here, please get in touch via [Avogadro Discussion](https://discuss.avogadro.cc).
