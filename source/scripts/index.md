# Script Plugins

Avogadro can be extended easily using Python scripts:

- [charges / electrostatics](charges)
- [commands](commands)
- [input generators](generators)
- [file formats](formats)

More script types are anticipated in the future, including:

- force field calculators
- web databases
- custom colors

Scripts can either be installed manually, by dragging to the Avogadro window,
or downloaded from GitHub repositories through the "Plugin Downloader" command.
