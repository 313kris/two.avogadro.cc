Avogadro is intended not only for molecular modeling research, but also for educational use. This category is intended to help educators around the world find lessons and tips for using Avogadro 2 in teaching chemistry. If you have an exercise or article that you would like to list here, please get in touch via [Avogadro Discussion](https://discuss.avogadro.cc).

[1,3-diaxial interactions](diaxial_interactions)

Investigate steric interactions in cyclohexane derivatives.

[Alkene Isomers](alkene_isomers)

Investigate the stability of alkene isomers due to steric interactions.

[Basic VSEPR](basic_vsepr)

Investigate molecular geometries using VSEPR rules.

[HCN dipole](hcn_dipole)

Investigate polar intermolecular interactions using HCN.

[Hydrogen Clusters](hydrogen_clusters)

Investigate the intermolecular interactions of solid hydrogen.

[Hydrogen Molecule](hydrogen_molecule)

Investigate the hydrogen molecule and its bond length using different force fields.

[Markovnikov's Rule](markovnikovs_rule)

Investigate the stability of reactions using Markovnikov's rule.

[Organic Hybridization](organic_hybridization)

Illustrate the geometry and bond lengths in sp<sup>3</sup>, sp<sup>2</sup> and sp hybridized carbons.

[Water](water)

Investigate the geometry of water and hydrogen bonding between molecules.

[Acid-Base Properties of Amino Acids](acid_base)

Investigate the pH-dependent protonation of amino acids.
