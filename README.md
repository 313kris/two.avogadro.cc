Core features and goals of the Avogadro project include:

* Open source distributed under the liberal 3-clause BSD license
* Cross platform with builds on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows
* Intuitive interface designed to be useful to whole community
* Fast and efficient embracing the latest technologies
* Extensible, making extensive use of a plugin architecture
* Flexible supporting a range of chemical data formats and packages

The code in this repository is a rewrite of Avogadro with source
code split across 
a [libraries repository](https://github.com/openchemistry/avogadrolibs) 
and an [application repository](https://github.com/openchemistry/avogadroapp).
The new code architecture provides a high-performance rendering engine, modern
code development, and significantly improved speed and stability.

Avogadro 2 is being developed as part of the [Open Chemistry][OpenChemistry]
project by an open community, and was started at [Kitware][Kitware] as
an open source community project. The Avogadro 1.x series currently has more
features, and can be found [here][Avogadro1]. We will be porting more features
to the Avogadro 2 code base, and making regular releases to get feedback from
the community.

We are actively working to finish Avogadro 2.0 in 2021.
